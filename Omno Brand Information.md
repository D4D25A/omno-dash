# Omno: Singapore’s Home-Grown Luxury Personal Care Brand

## Founders and Company Background

**Origins:** Omno is a Singapore-based personal care brand founded amidst the COVID-19 pandemic (launched in March 2021) to fill a gap in the body care market. It was created by **Carmen Butt**, who serves as Founder and Brand Ambassador. Carmen’s background in pharmaceutical/biochemical science and experience running a distribution company for niche lifestyle brands (like New Zealand’s Ashley & Co) provided deep industry knowledge behind Omno. The founders had been distributing some of the world’s finest personal care products to high-end hotels and venues, which inspired them to develop their own sustainable luxury brand.

**Brand Name and Mission:** The name “Omno” is derived from the word *“moon,”* reflecting a philosophy of **equilibrium** and balance between personal well-being and the planet. The stylized letter “Ø” in the logo signifies “zero nonsense and zero compromise,” underscoring the brand’s sincerity in keeping its promises. Omno’s mission is *“to pamper our customers **and** Mother Earth,”* emphasizing both indulgent self-care and environmental stewardship. In line with this mission, all products are 100% vegan and cruelty-free, and the company insists on ethical sourcing at every step (partnering with certification bodies like ECOCERT, COSMOS, Nordic Swan Ecolabel, and the USDA BioPreferred program to validate its standards). The brand also weaves inclusivity and social impact into its ethos – for example, since 2023 Omno has partnered with local organizations (APSN and Thye Hua Kwan Moral Society) to provide vocational training and employment for persons with intellectual disabilities. Likewise, since 2022 Omno has supported environmental causes such as coral reef restoration, pledging to plant one coral for every purchase as part of its sustainability commitment. These values of **luxury, sustainability, and inclusivity** are central to Omno’s identity (described by Harper’s Bazaar as a brand that makes body care a “luxurious ritual” with *“luxury, sustainability, and inclusivity in mind”*).

**Company Timeline:** Conceived in 2020 and officially launched in 2021, Omno began as an **internet-first** D2C brand, but quickly expanded its footprint. By 2022, its products were carried in around 30 high-end restaurants in Singapore – including the Michelin-starred Burnt Ends – as a way to introduce the brand to discerning consumers through experiential touchpoints. Omno’s rapid growth led to partnerships with premier hospitality venues; as of 2023, Omno amenities are featured in **50+ venues** internationally, notably in the iconic Raffles Hotel Singapore and luxury hotels like ELSE Kuala Lumpur. In late 2023, Omno opened its first brick-and-mortar flagship store at “New Bahru,” a new lifestyle hub in River Valley, Singapore. (Earlier in 2023 it also established retail presence at Orchard Road and Jewel Changi Airport.) This flagship “sanctuary” store is designed with *moon-inspired, symmetrical* interiors that mirror Omno’s holistic philosophy – blending the moon’s ethereal glow with earthly elements. Today, Omno continues to be proudly “Singapore born, Asia raised, green-based, nature-bound,” as its social media tagline proclaims, and is focused on strengthening its local brand while gradually making inroads into regional markets (e.g. launching in Malaysia and Taiwan).

## Product Range and Offerings

Omno offers a **premium range of skin, hair, and body care products** that transform everyday routines into indulgent rituals. All formulations are crafted to suit Southeast Asian climates and **reimagine body care with skincare-level quality** ingredients. Key categories and product offerings include:

* **Hand & Body Cleansers:** The brand’s signature products are its **luxurious body washes**, which double as hand cleansers. They come in three core scent collections – **Solace**, **Moonatic**, and **Odyssey** – each with a distinct fragrance profile and matching product lineup. *Solace* is a zesty citrus-ginger blend, *Moonatic* offers a woody sage and cypress aroma, and *Odyssey* features exotic rose-and-spice notes, a tribute to Asian botanical heritage. These cleansers are formulated with gentle, plant-derived surfactants and enriched with **“facial-grade” skincare actives** like niacinamide and hyaluronic acid to nourish the skin. Notably, Omno’s body washes are lighter in texture than many Western brands’, an intentional tweak for humid tropical weather – e.g. the lotions absorb quickly and feel non-greasy on skin.

* **Hair Care:** Omno produces **hair cleansers** (shampoos) – and recently, conditioners – that extend the brand’s ethos to scalp care. The **Solace Hair Cleanser**, for instance, is infused with hydrolyzed pea protein to strengthen hair, and like all Omno formulas, is free of sulfates, parabens, and silicones. Reviewers note that gradual use helps soothe sensitive scalps, leading to healthier-looking hair. (Omno’s approach is to treat scalp and hair with the same level of care as facial skin, using proven ingredients for performance.) A complementary **hair conditioner** was introduced to ensure a complete hair routine – a company blog highlights the importance of conditioning for luxurious, nourished hair.

* **Body Lotion & Moisturizers:** Each scent line offers a **Hand & Body Lotion** that pairs with the cleansers. These lotions are lightweight yet deeply hydrating – formulated with ingredients like niacinamide for improving skin texture and plant-based emollients that absorb without sticky residue. For example, the **Gaea Hand & Body Lotion** (part of a later-introduced collection) contains extra niacinamide and a coconut-derived humectant, delivering long-lasting moisture with a dewy finish. All lotions are dermatologically tested to be gentle and are free of harsh chemicals, making them suitable even for sensitive skin. Omno also offers a **Radiant Body Oil** (Solace) for those who prefer an oil-based moisturizer, blending botanical oils to give skin a healthy sheen.

* **Scrubs and Exfoliants:** To round out the body care ritual, Omno produces **Sugar & Salt Body Scrubs** (in scents like Solace and Moonatic) that gently exfoliate and nourish. These scrubs are packed with natural exfoliants and oils (olive, jojoba, sunflower, etc.) and are praised for leaving the skin moisturized and “spa-like” after use. Customers report the scrubs have *“great scent”* and luxurious texture that make at-home pampering feel like a high-end spa experience.

* **Deodorants and Fragrance:** Omno extends into personal fragrance with its **natural deodorant sprays** and **rollerball perfumes**. The **Moonatic and Revival Deodorant Sprays** use ECOCERT-certified botanical extracts to neutralize odor for up to 12 hours, all while being alcohol-free and skin flora-friendly. (Omno chose a gentle active, IR3535, over harsh chemicals like aluminum or DEET, making the deodorants safe even for sensitive skin and children.) For fragrance, **“The Rollerball Perfume”** line includes portable roll-on perfumes (e.g. Odyssey rollerball) that layer the signature scents in a personal fragrance format. These have become popular as an on-the-go way to “wear” Omno’s scents, and the brand even offers a free full-size rollerball perfume to loyal customers during their birthday month.

* **Specialty and Lifestyle Products:** Staying true to its *“personal care reconceptualised”* tagline, Omno has developed some unique products for specific needs. One highlight is the **EcoWarrior Mosquito Repellent Spray**, a DEET-free insect repellent with a mild herbal scent that doesn’t overpower one’s personal fragrance. This spray uses a proven active (IR3535) and essential oils to effectively ward off mosquitoes and even ticks, all while being safe for all ages – aligning with Omno’s ethos of gentle yet effective care. Another innovation is the **Gaea Solar Defence** sunscreen (SPF 50+ broad spectrum) introduced under the *Gaea* line, which provides high UV protection without heavy residues. For post-sun or general soothing, Omno offers **Soothe Rollers** (e.g. Gaea Soothe Roller) – calming aromatherapeutic oil blends for relieving stress or minor skin irritations. Rounding out the lifestyle range are products like the **Sanitising Hand Pleaser** (a moisturizing hand sanitizer), and **Bedtime Mists** (pillow sprays in Solace and Gaea scents) to incorporate Omno’s fragrances into home and travel routines.

**Ingredients and Formulation Philosophy:** Across its product range, Omno emphasizes **natural and high-quality ingredients** backed by science. Most ingredients are plant-derived and carry reputable certifications (ECOCERT, Nordic Swan, COSMOS, USDA BioPreferred, etc.), ensuring they meet strict standards for sustainability and safety. The formulations are **100% free of sulfates, parabens, silicones, and animal testing**. Instead, Omno uses mild cleansers (e.g. sugar cane and coconut-derived surfactants) and skin-friendly actives (like vitamin B3, hyaluronic acid, botanical oils and extracts) to achieve results without irritation. The brand actively researches cutting-edge cosmetic science – Regine Han, Omno’s PR head, noted that the team continuously looks at clinical studies to ensure every ingredient has proven efficacy. For example, Omno’s use of niacinamide and saccharide isomerate in body lotion is aimed at strengthening the skin barrier and providing prolonged hydration in a tropical climate.

**Design & Packaging:** In terms of packaging design, Omno balances aesthetics with eco-consciousness. The products have a minimalist, elegant look – often in recyclable aluminum or frosted plastic bottles emblazoned with the distinctive “Ø” logo – conveying a modern *“less is more”* luxury. Importantly, the bottles are made from **70% post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastic and 30% recyclable PET**, significantly reducing the brand’s carbon footprint. Even the outer boxes and materials are chosen for sustainability. This is part of Omno’s pledge to be *“gentle on your skin, and on the planet,”* extending beyond formulas to the entire product life cycle. The thoughtful design philosophy won Omno accolades and partnerships; for instance, Omno co-created special edition co-branded packaging for Zen (a two-Michelin-star restaurant in Singapore) to provide a seamless branded amenity for their diners. Overall, Omno’s product offerings reflect a **holistic design philosophy**: create effective, enjoyable personal care products that engage the senses (through refined scents and textures) while aligning with ethical and environmental principles.

## Pricing and Market Positioning

Omno positions itself in the **premium boutique** segment of personal care, often drawing comparisons to established luxury brands like Aesop. As *Time Out Singapore* put it: *“Forget Aesop – there’s a local equivalent that’s just as luxurious”*. Omno’s price points reflect its high-end formulations and sustainable packaging, yet the brand aims to remain accessible relative to global luxury competitors.

**General Pricing:** Omno products are priced in the mid-to-high range for bath and body care. As of 2024, the flagship **Hand & Body Cleansers** retail at around **S\$45** for a full-size bottle (300–500ml). The matching **Body Lotions** are about **S\$55–\$66** (with Solace Lotion at S\$56 and the specialized Gaea Lotion at S\$66). **Body Scrubs** (large jar) cost roughly **S\$63**. **Hair Cleansers (Shampoos)** are similarly around **S\$45** per bottle. In the fragrance category, the **Rollerball Perfumes** are about **S\$39** each, and the **Deodorant Sprays** are a relatively affordable **S\$19** (with travel-size minis as low as S\$5). More novel items like the **Mosquito Repellent** and **Soothe Rollers** fall in the S\$29–\$35 range. The brand also offers bundled ritual sets (e.g. a cleanser+lotion set) around **S\$100+** and travel kits under S\$50 to cater to different customer needs. Overall, while Omno’s pricing is not bargain-level, it is **competitive for its category** – especially considering the clean, imported-quality ingredients and the large product sizes. Indeed, Time Out noted that all these products come *“with a relatively affordable price tag”* given the certifications and quality, positioning Omno as a high-value alternative to pricier foreign luxury brands.

**Market Positioning:** Omno firmly occupies a **premium, design-driven niche** in the personal care market. The brand is often described as *“luxurious, sustainably-minded, yet approachable.”* By combining **luxury branding** (sleek packaging, sophisticated scents) with a **conscious ethos** (green ingredients, social impact), Omno appeals to modern consumers who want **eco-conscious quality**. Its aesthetic is minimalist and chic – aligning with a contemporary *“less is more”* luxury trend – and its focus on **scent profiles** and **ritual** taps into the self-care movement. Omno also leverages its Singaporean identity, proudly marketing itself as a “home-grown” brand that understands Asian skin needs. This localization helps differentiate it from Western imports: for example, Omno’s lightweight tropical-friendly lotions and inclusion of Asian botanical notes (like ginger, sage, etc.) resonate with local/regional customers. At the same time, its quality and presentation are world-class, allowing it to stand alongside international boutique brands in high-end retailers or hotels.

In terms of **competitive positioning**, Omno has been likened to brands like Aesop, Le Labo or Ashley & Co, but with a Singaporean soul. The brand’s presence in luxury hotels, Michelin-star restaurants, and premium fitness clubs enhances its *prestige perception*. For instance, being the chosen amenities supplier for Raffles Hotel’s suites or a fine-dining restaurant’s washroom signals that Omno is a **status brand** for those in-the-know. Yet, Omno strives to remain inclusive; by keeping prices slightly below some imported luxury competitors and offering smaller sizes, it invites a broader audience to experience its products without extreme cost barriers. This balance of **premium positioning with relative affordability** is a deliberate strategy to build a loyal customer base in Singapore and eventually across Asia.

**Brand Image:** Omno markets itself as a **“luxury with a conscience”**. The brand tone is gentle, nurturing, and sophisticated. Words like *“Everything in Equilibrium”* and *“Personal care reconceptualised”* are used in branding, signaling that Omno isn’t just selling soap, but a lifestyle of mindful indulgence. The **design philosophy** (moon symbolism, symmetry, nature-inspired themes) reinforces an image of calm, harmony, and subtle luxury. Packaging in neutral tones with the distinctive Ø logo communicates modern elegance. Omno’s retail store experience further cements its positioning: the flagship boutique is designed to be an oasis where customers can *touch, smell, and experience* the products in person – aligning with the brand’s emphasis on sensorial luxury. This careful curation of image has placed Omno in the **premium tier of local brands**, often featured in high society and lifestyle media as an exemplar of Singaporean luxury entrepreneurship.

## Customer Reviews and Public Perception

Omno has garnered **very positive reviews** from customers and the public, establishing a strong reputation in a short time. Across various platforms, users consistently praise Omno’s product quality, sensorial appeal, and brand values:

* **Overall Ratings:** Based on hundreds of verified buyer reviews, Omno achieves an average rating of about **4.9 out of 5 stars** – indicating near-universal satisfaction. By early 2025, the brand’s site had aggregated over **800 customer reviews**, with approximately **89%** of them being 5-star ratings. Such a high rating is rare in the beauty sector and speaks to the consistency of Omno’s offerings. Customers frequently become repeat buyers, often expanding their collection from a single product to the full regimen after experiencing the results.

* **Common Praise:** A recurring theme in reviews is the **fragrance and feel** of Omno products. Many customers highlight the *“great scent”* of the cleansers and scrubs, noting that the aromas are natural, soothing, and not overpowering. The Solace and Moonatic scents, in particular, have developed a fan following for their unique blends (citrus-ginger and woody sage respectively). Users also love the texture and after-feel of the products: the body scrub *“leaves \[skin] feeling moisturised,”* and the lotions are described as *“nourishing yet non-greasy”*. One reviewer likened the experience to a “luxurious spa” at home, and another said the products *“smell amazing”* and leave a *“fresh and \[glowing] sheen”* on the skin. The gentle nature of the formulas is also a highlight – customers with sensitive skin or scalps report improvements, e.g. reduced itchiness and healthier hair after using the shampoos over time. The **effectiveness** of functional products like the mosquito repellent and deodorant is mentioned too; one buyer called the repellent *“a life saver…very efficient and the smell is so mild,”* appreciating that it’s suitable for someone sensitive to strong odors. Overall, the brand has successfully delivered on its promises, as evidenced by the abundance of positive testimonials.

* **Customer Service:** Beyond the products themselves, Omno receives kudos for its customer service and shopping experience. Shoppers who visited the New Bahru flagship store recount being warmly welcomed and educated about the products. In one review, a customer remarked *“the cherry on top is the amazing customer service you get when you go to their store,”* noting the staff’s pleasant and thorough explanations. The brand often responds to online reviews with personalized thank-you notes and additional usage tips, reflecting a highly engaged approach to customer care. This has helped cultivate a positive community around the brand, with many reviewers encouraging others to support this local business.

* **Public and Media Perception:** In the public eye, Omno has been lauded as a **success story of Singaporean innovation** in beauty. Media features (in *Luxurious Magazine*, *Harper’s Bazaar Singapore*, *The Peak*, etc.) emphasize Omno’s blend of quality and sustainability, often highlighting its mission to treat body care with the same respect as skincare. The brand’s initiatives – such as using eco-friendly packaging and hiring persons with disabilities – have been well-received as genuine efforts rather than marketing ploys, helping to build trust. On social media, local influencers and beauty enthusiasts have shared Omno “unboxing” and “store tour” posts, commenting on the stylish packaging and pleasant scents. The collaboration with Miss Malaysia Universe 2019 *Alexis SueAnn* (who appeared in Omno’s campaigns during the Malaysia launch) also added glamorous visibility to the brand. Moreover, Omno’s presence in elite venues (like five-star hotels and exclusive clubs) has cemented a perception of the brand as *aspirational*. Many first-time users actually encountered Omno at a restaurant or gym washroom and were impressed enough to look up the brand afterward. This word-of-mouth marketing has been powerful – one could say Omno’s products themselves act as “ambassadors” when placed in luxury settings.

* **Critiques:** It is notable that **negative feedback is sparse**. A tiny fraction of reviews (\~1%) are 1- or 2-stars. The few critical comments that appear are usually about personal scent preferences or logistical issues (e.g. a customer wished for more promotions or wasn’t aware of a review-linked discount program). There hasn’t been any significant public controversy or quality concern reported. In fact, Omno’s transparent communication (such as detailed ingredient breakdowns and responsiveness to questions) seems to preempt many potential concerns. For example, the brand openly educates consumers on why it avoids certain chemicals and how it sources ingredients, which bolsters confidence. If anything, some observers wondered if a Singaporean brand could justify a premium price tag, but the consistent high ratings and repeat purchases suggest that customers do feel it’s worth the money for the experience and values offered.

In summary, **customer sentiment toward Omno is overwhelmingly positive**. The brand has built a loyal following that appreciates its sensorial richness, ethical stance, and local roots. With an average of \~4.9★ satisfaction and glowing recommendations like *“no regrets – definitely a great buy!”*, Omno’s public perception is that of a **rising star in beauty** – one that delivers luxury *and* conscience in equal measure. As one media tagline aptly suggested, Omno has made **body care** into a *“luxurious ritual”* for its users.

## Marketing and Social Media

Omno’s marketing strategy is a blend of **high-touch experiential marketing, community-building, and digital innovation**, all executed with a consistent brand voice. The company has been savvy in creating buzz and aligning its marketing with its core values:

* **Experiential & Partnership Marketing:** Rather than relying purely on traditional ads, Omno got its start by placing products in context – literally. The team strategically partnered with esteemed hotels, restaurants, and fitness studios to let consumers *experience* Omno in their daily lives. For instance, Omno supplied its hand washes and lotions to dozens of trendy F\&B venues (like Neon Pigeon and Tanjong Beach Club) and boutique gyms (Core Collective, Boxing Spartans, etc.). Diners and gym-goers encountering Omno in washrooms or locker rooms would often be impressed by the scent and quality, generating organic curiosity. This approach of “completing the sensorial experience” – e.g. enhancing a fine dining visit with a lovely hand-wash in the restroom – not only delights the venue’s customers but subtly markets Omno’s brand. Omno also engaged in **co-branding collaborations**: a notable example is the custom packaging created for Zen Restaurant (a Michelin-star establishment) to offer co-branded Omno amenities for their guests. Such partnerships associate Omno with top-tier experiences, reinforcing its luxury image through **word-of-mouth** endorsements. By 2024, Omno proudly showcases a roster of partners on its website (from **Burnt Ends** to **Raffles Hotel**), essentially using B2B relationships as marketing channels.

* **Digital Presence & E-commerce:** As an “internet-first” brand, Omno places heavy emphasis on its **online presence**. The official website (omno.store) is not just an online shop but also an educational resource – featuring an Ethos section, blog articles on sustainability and product usage, and even an interactive scent finder. The brand’s tone online is informative, upbeat, and inclusive. It often uses phrases like *“personal care with purpose”* and invites users to join its mission. Social media is a key pillar: Omno is active on **Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok**, sharing content ranging from product spotlights to behind-the-scenes looks. Their Instagram (@omno.store) carries a cohesive aesthetic with earthy tones and calming imagery, reflecting the “everything in equilibrium” mantra. Posts highlight ingredients (e.g. “Did You Know?” features about Nordic Swan-certified extracts), customer testimonials, and sustainability tips, thereby positioning the brand as an authority in clean beauty. On TikTok, Omno has experimented with storytelling – one video titled “From idea to reality – Omno’s journey in the personal care world” introduces the brand ambassador (Carmen) and the brand story in a relatable, short-form format. By embracing platforms like TikTok, Omno targets a younger, savvy audience, using hashtags like #CleanBeauty and #OmnoGlow to increase discoverability.

* **Influencer and Community Engagement:** Omno’s marketing team understands the value of **social proof**. They’ve engaged local influencers and beauty experts to try and review Omno products. For example, beauty queen **Alexis SueAnn** was featured at Omno’s Malaysian launch event (and in glossy photoshoots) to lend star appeal. In Singapore, micro-influencers in wellness and lifestyle have posted about Omno, often focusing on the brand’s eco-friendly angle (“supporting local and sustainable!”) which resonates with their followers. Rather than mass sponsorships, Omno appears selective, choosing opinion leaders who genuinely align with the brand’s ethos. Furthermore, Omno actively cultivates a community among its customers. It responds to almost every review online with personalized messages, as seen on its site’s review page. It also incentivizes engagement through a **loyalty program** – notably an innovative NFT-based loyalty initiative launched in 2022. This program issued digital collectibles (non-fungible tokens) to loyal customers, granting them perks and a sense of being part of an exclusive club. *“As a technology-driven brand, our loyalty programme also needs to be digital. NFTs are great for that,”* an Omno representative explained. This blend of tech and marketing was unusual for a beauty brand, earning Omno press coverage and attracting tech-savvy consumers. It exemplifies how Omno isn’t afraid to experiment with new marketing frontiers (like blockchain) to stand out and create a buzz.

* **Brand Tone and Messaging:** Across all channels, Omno maintains a **consistent tone** that is caring, aspirational, and transparent. The brand often communicates like a friendly expert – offering tips (e.g. how to layer scents or the importance of conditioner), sharing the science behind ingredients, and updating customers on its sustainability progress. The messaging strikes a balance between *luxury* and *approachability*: for instance, an Instagram post might show the elegant packaging in a nature setting with a caption about self-care and environmental care going hand-in-hand. Omno’s tagline “Everything in Equilibrium” is not only a slogan but woven into their content, reinforcing themes of balance (between self and planet, science and nature, luxury and responsibility). The brand also projects authenticity by spotlighting its *local roots*. It uses language like “proudly created in Singapore” and celebrates Southeast Asian culture – e.g. referencing tropical climates, or using local personalities in campaigns. This has helped build trust and a proud local customer base who often mention they are happy to “support a home-grown brand that knows our needs”. Omno’s social media also highlights its **CSR efforts** (such as posting about coral planting days or the work with APSN trainees) which humanizes the brand and generates goodwill.

* **Campaign Highlights:** One of Omno’s notable campaigns was its **Malaysia market debut in late 2023**. The brand hosted a launch event at Else Hotel in Kuala Lumpur, featuring Carmen Butt and Alexis SueAnn as speakers. The event combined a product showcase with a wellness workout session (in partnership with Tribe Fitness), exemplifying Omno’s lifestyle approach. It garnered press coverage in regional beauty blogs and created a spike in social media mentions around the theme *“Envisioning a Radiant Tomorrow”* for beauty. Another creative campaign was Omno’s **“One Coral for Every Purchase”** pledge which they promoted during Earth Month: for each product sold, a coral fragment is planted via a marine charity. This campaign not only drove sales with a purpose but also gave the marketing team rich content to share (e.g. videos of coral planting, statistics of carbon-neutral orders, etc., which were displayed on their site). It positioned Omno as more than a product – as a movement for conscious living.

In the retail sphere, Omno’s opening at New Bahru was itself a marketing push. The concept of a **“sensory sanctuary”** store was emphasized in media – inviting people to come in and *“touch and smell”* everything. The store features a large island counter for interactive product testing and often hosts workshops (DIY scent-crafting sessions, sustainability talks, etc.) as part of community engagement. These in-store events are advertised on social channels and often booked out, demonstrating strong interest.

**Summary:** Omno’s marketing and social media efforts have been quite **holistic and modern**. By embedding the brand in real-life experiences, harnessing digital platforms, engaging in two-way communication with customers, and highlighting a genuine commitment to values, Omno has built a brand that people feel connected to. The tone is inspirational but not preachy – as one Facebook post succinctly put it: *“gentle on your skin, gentle on the planet”*. This positive, enlightened messaging has attracted a community of followers who don’t just buy soap, but buy into the Omno lifestyle. As the brand grows, its marketing continues to position Omno as a thought leader in sustainable luxury (sharing knowledge and leading by example), while its social media presence keeps the brand **visible, relatable, and relevant** to its audience. If Omno’s rapid rise is any indication, its marketing formula of **purpose + polish** is resonating deeply with today’s consumers, both online and offline.

**Sources:** The information above is compiled from official Omno materials and reputable publications, including *Luxurious Magazine*, *CosmeticsDesign-Asia*, *Time Out Singapore*, Omno’s official website and social media, and verified customer reviews. These sources provide a comprehensive view of Omno’s history, products, and public reception. The data reflects the state of the brand as of 2024–2025, illustrating how Omno has grown from a pandemic-born idea to a leading name in sustainable personal care in Singapore.
